                            KEA may grant the transfer of programme elements or parts thereof according to this curriculum which are passed at another educational institution and which are equivalent to programme elements or parts thereof in this curriculum. If the programme element in question has been assessed according to the 7-point grading scale at the institution where the exam has been taken and is equivalent to a programme element in this curriculum, the grade may be transferred. KEA may grant the transfer of programme elements completed at another Danish or foreign institution of higher education to replace programme elements covered by this curriculum. If a credit transfer is granted, programme elements are deemed to have been completed if they have been passed in accordance with the rules applicable to the programme in question. The assessment is transferred as ‘passed’.

                            Having passed the first-year exam, students can choose to complete either the entire programme or parts of it abroad. KEA offers multiple possibilities for international study, including the fourthsemester internship. Information on partner institutions, international internships, credit transfers and procedures are published regularly by KEA.

                        Successfully completed programme elements are equivalent to the corresponding programme elements at other educational institutions offering the programme. Students are obliged to provide information on completed programme elements from other Danish or foreign higher education programmes and on any employment for which credit transfer may be granted. On a case-by-case basis, KEA approves credit transfers based on completed programme elements and employment comparable to subjects, programme elements and internships. The decision is based on an academic evaluation.
