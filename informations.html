                    <p>The internship can form the basis of the student’s final project and can be organised in a flexible and differentiated manner. Students can choose to combine internships in two or more organisations or different types of internships. The conditions governing internships are described in more detail on the learning platform for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme before the fourth semester begins. The internship is unpaid. Based on the general learning objectives for the internship period, students develop their own individual learning objectives for their internship in cooperation with the host company and KEA. During the internship, students are assigned a supervisor from the programme and a contact/supervisor from the host organisation. The internship is concluded with an exam (internship exam).</p>

                    <p>Cheating at exams will be handled in accordance with the rules set out in the Ministerial Order on Examinations on Professionally Oriented Higher Education Programmes (the Examination Order). Students who cheat at an exam will be expelled from the exam. In case of aggravating circumstances, students may be suspended from KEA for a long or short period of time. In such event, students must be issued with a written warning stating that repeated cheating may result in permanent expulsion. Cheating includes: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>obtaining unlawful help during an exam</li>

                        <li>presenting other people’s work as one’s own</li>
                        <li>using own previously assessed work without stating the source</li>
                        <li>using materials and aids not permitted for the exam in question</li>

                <p>Expulsion from an exam due to cheating means that the awarded grade will be withdrawn, and the student will have used one exam attempt.

                    <p>
                        The teaching is a combination of classroom instruction, lectures, workshops, study groups, exercises, major project work and not least guidance. The teaching is planned on the basis of relevant business practice and applied theory. On the programme, teaching methods are used which are aimed at developing the students’ independence as well as their collaborative and innovative skills. In so far as is relevant, the programme covers issues like entrepreneurship, environmental issues and the dynamics of intercultural encounters.
